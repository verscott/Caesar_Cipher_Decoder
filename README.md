# Caesar_Cipher_Decoder

This is a simple-to-use Caesar cipher decoder program written in C++ without knowing which shift the input was initially encoded into. It outputs the 6 most likely decoded messages.

Usage: compile the program by typing g++ -g -ansi -Wall decipher.cpp -o decipher.out

afterwards, run the program by specifying the input file which contains the enciphered text you want to decipher by:

./decipher.out filename.txt
